# H3C_BANK

## Introduction
This program has a bug that prevents it from running questions with images. I am still learning how to create a JSON question bank with images and GUI layout, but I am working hard to learn.

### Version Updates
- **1.3 Update:** This update fixes a bug with the display of the answer sheet and adds an automatic update feature.
- **1.4 Update:** This update adds a mock exam feature, and the exam review is under development. The main GUI has been optimized.
- **1.5 Update:** This update adds a review feature for incorrect questions, and the feature for reviewing mistakes is under development.

## Instructions for Use

Click `main.exe` to start.

### How to Import the Question Bank
Place the question bank with a `.json` extension into the `bank` folder.

This program is open source, and the code is in the `main` file. I hope to receive guidance from experts.

This program is open source on GitHub, and I welcome feedback from experts.

This is the first software I have written. Although it is a practice project, the version is **1.5 Beta**, and there are many bugs.

More practical features will be added in the future.
