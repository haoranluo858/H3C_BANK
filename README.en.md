# H3C_BANK

## Introduction

This update fixes the bug related to the display of the answer sheet and adds an automatic update feature.

## Usage Instructions

Click `main.exe` to start.

To import the question bank: place the `.json` files into the `bank` folder.

This program is open source, and the code is in the `main` folder. I hope to receive guidance from experienced developers.

This is my first software project. Although it is a practice project, the version is **1.1 Beta**, and there are many bugs.

More practical features will be added in the future.
