Version 1.3 Update: This update fixes a bug with the display of the answer sheet and adds an automatic update feature.  
Version 1.4 Update: This update adds a mock exam feature, and the exam review is under development. The main interface GUI has been optimized.

## Usage Instructions

Click `main.exe` to start.

How to import the question bank: Place the question bank with a `.json` extension into the `bank` folder.

This program is open source, and the code is in the `main` file. I hope to receive guidance from experts.

This is my first software project. Although it is a practice version, it is **Version 1.4 Beta**, and there are many bugs.

More practical features will be added in the future.
